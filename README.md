# [Under construction] Code: Critical initialisation for deep signal propagation in noisy rectifier neural networks
**While all the code necessary to reproduce results in the paper is present, it is not yet in a user friendly state.**
**Expect this to change soon.**

This repository provides the code to reproduce all the results in the paper: "Critical initialisation for deep signal propagation in noisy rectifier neural networks" (NIPS 2018).

The code was written by Elan Van Biljon, Arnu Pretorius and Herman Kamper. Large portions of the code was originally adapted from code that was made available in Poole et al. (2016) at https://github.com/ganguli-lab/deepchaos.

## Basic steps for Figures 2-5

To reproduce Figures 2-5 in the paper please follow the steps below.

#### Step 1. Install [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html).

#### Step 2. Clone the research code repository. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ElanVB/noisy_signal_prop.git
```

#### Step 3. Activate the environment

```bash
cd noisy_signal_prop
conda env create -f environments/simple_env_gpu.yml
```

If your machine does not have a GPU, please use `simple_env_cpu.yml` instead. Furthermore, full specs can be found in `specific_env.yml`.

#### Step 4. Run code in notebooks

Launch Jupyter server

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

and run the cells in the notebook corresponding to the Figure in the paper you wish to reproduce (e.g. `Figure_2_deep_noisy_signal_prop.ipynb`).

## Steps for larger scale experiments in Figure 6 (GPU required): 

Below are the instructions to reproduce the plots in Figure 6 using a docker image and the notebook provided.

#### Step 1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker).

#### Step 2. Obtain the research environment image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ufoym/deepo/).

```bash
docker pull ufoym/deepo:tensorflow
```
#### Step 3. Clone the research code repository. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ElanVB/noisy_signal_prop.git
```

#### Step 4. Generate experimental results (**Warning: this may take many hours to run.**)

```bash
cd noisy_signal_prop/src
docker run --runtime=nvidia -v "$(pwd)":/experiment -it ufoym/deepo:tensorflow bash experiment/start.sh
```

#### Step 5. Run plotting code in the notebook

Launch Jupyter server 

```bash
cd ..
jupyter notebook
```

and run the cells in the notebook `Figure_6_depth_scales_mnist_cifar10.ipynb`. To stop the docker container from running simply shutdown the notebook by pressing ctrl+c (the container will automatically be removed once stopped).
